Project 1: Week 2

Description: 
Please click the link on the right panel to play around the cube. You can either change the dimension, position, coloring, rotation and animation of the cube. The other implementation will be implemented next week as well as the orbit control and JSN object library.


Problems Solving and Encountered Problems:
I created the GUI control panel by importing the dat.GUI library. I was able to rotate, move, and animated the cube via the control Panel. However, I was getting an error when I tried to implemented the Orbit Control library to allow me to rotate the views as I wanted. Thus, Before next weekâ€™s due date I hope to finished the orbit control, and created a more complex 3d object before the end of next week.
