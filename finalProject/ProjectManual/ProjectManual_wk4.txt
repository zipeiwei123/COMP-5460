Description: 

	In this week, I started to build the interface from a whole views. The added features are including:
	
	1) switch camera between Perspective and Orthographics by clicking switchCamera.

	2)change plane colors by clicking ambientColor.

	3)add cube in the plane by clicking addCube. Delete cube in the plane by clicking removeCube. outputObjects will output current sceneâ€™s children in the console.
	
	4)numberofObjects will output current scene.children. Play around with addCube and removeCube to see the number of objects changes. 

	4)scale, position and changeTexture is currently not working. Will be fixed before the next submission.
