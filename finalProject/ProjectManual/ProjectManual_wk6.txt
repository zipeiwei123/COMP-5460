In this week, I added more elements and controls for the webgl. I sorted them according to their functions and usability, I summed up according to each GUI folders:

1)Camera Folder:

	Click on the drop down menu of Camera Folder:

 	Scrolling:
 		Speed: speed controls how fast the camera spins around the scene. 
 		Y: y controls the y position of the camera
 	Clicking: 
		switchCamera: switch the camera view of from perspective to Orthographic
2)Light Folder:

		ambientColor: changing the lighting color of the plane
		pointColor: changing the light color of all the objects on the plane

3)Add 2D Elevation:

	Click on the drop down menu of Create_Geometries Folder:

	NumberofObjects: This output in the gui text area to show how many objects currently on the scene.

	Draw_2D_Shape: clicking on the ‘Draw_2D_Shape’, you can start to draw on the canvas, For instance: everytime you click on the canvas,  a 2d-3d point will be added on the canvas, if click 2 points, a line will be drawing from point to point. To stop drawing, press any key on the key board.

	Elevation_3D: Once you created a 2D object from the previous step, click the Elevation_3D to ascending the 2D shape to 3D. In this case, you can create as weird 3D geometries as you wanted. 


4)Add 3D Geometry:

	create a random size of 3D Cube, 3D Cone, and 3D Cylinder in random position of the canvas by clicking each geometry’s button. 

5)Modifies_3D_Geometrics Folder:
