Project 1: Week 1


Mar 28th, 

In this week, I was only able to explore the basic function and features about Webgl. Luckliy, I was able to learn how to scale, rotate by using the vector that I learned in class. Thus, I would wish to achieve the camera effect and scale/rotation by allowing the userâ€™s input next week.
