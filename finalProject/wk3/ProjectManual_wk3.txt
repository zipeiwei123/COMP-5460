Project 1: Week 3

Description: 
Please click the link on the right panel to play around the cube. I added a few more functions besides the installment from last week, such as switching the camera location, light shadowing, camera rotation, add the grid panel as well as the wireframe function. In the next week, I will started to create a more complex geometry by simply clicking the geometry on the control panel and added multiple geometries. 

Problems Solving and Encountered Problems:
I was able to play around with gui and all the other features. The problems I encountered is how to dynamically implemented different geometries according to the userâ€™s input. I will accomplish that before the next week assignment.
