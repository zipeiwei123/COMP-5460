Project 1: Week 4

April 18th, 
In this week, I started to get a more general understand of three.js. I was able to create multiple objects in the interface as as well as add more gui controls. I will start to make individual object manipulation before the next submission. Most of my works are learned by referring many examples at the three.js.
