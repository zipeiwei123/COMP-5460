Project 1: Homework 1

Description: I was using the midpoint algorithm, Bresenham algorithm, DDA line algorithm and scan line algorithm to construct the line, circle, rectangle, ellipse, and polygons (half way)...

I used the html and javascript to finish this assignment. I will install openGL and c++ for later 3D drawing.
