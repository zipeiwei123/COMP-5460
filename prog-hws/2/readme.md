Project 1: Homework 2

Note: One thing I have notice is, the color filling in driver score section will not work on certain browser. I tested the code in Google Chrome, if the code is not working, please switch to Google Chrome.

Description: 
I was able to finish most part of this assignment. The one thing that I found it is difficult is after the first iteration, to store all the coordinates in an array and using each elements on the array to generate a new fractal function. Unlike KochCurve and Fractal tree (which they called the generate function on a fixed variants), I found it I calling a for loop for the generate function, it will not terminate due to the first element of the array is looping forever. Thus, in order to terminate the program, I was only able to call the first element on the array list iteratively. This is the obstacle that I encountered in this assignment.
